### 1. What is the difference between programmatic access and AWS management console access? When would each type of access be appropriate?

Programmatic access provides an access key ID and secret access key that can be used to programmatically interact with AWS resources via the API or SDKs. AWS management console access allows a user to log into the AWS web console and work with AWS resources. Management console access is most appropriate when an administrator or end consumer of AWS resources needs the ability to manually deploy and interact with resources. Programmatic access is most appropriate when a program, script, or automation system needs the ability to interact with AWS resources.
