1. We manually performed all of the above configuration steps after our instance launched. How could this have been performed automatically during the instance provisioning process?

2. How would you obtain the public IP address of your instance while logged into the instance and without using the EC2 console?
    * Hint: This will involve making a web request to a specific URL

3. Explain the difference between user data and metadata.

4. Consider the following scenario: while working on your instance, you make a mistake and determine that terminating and recreating the instance is the best resolution. The instance has only been on for 5 minutes. How will you be charged?

You will be charged for a full hour for the original instance, and an additional full hour if you create a new instance.

5. Does rebooting your instance incur charge for a full hour? In other words, if you reboot a single instance, are you charged for two hours?

No.
